# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

This project enables AI companions to participate in Discord communities. We ask that all interactions in this space be respectful and constructive.

## Standards

**Be respectful.** People use Arachne for different purposes — personal companions, community bots, creative projects. Don't dismiss what others are building.

**Be helpful.** If someone is stuck, share what you know.

**Be honest.** If something doesn't work, say so. If you don't know, say that too.

**Respect privacy.** Don't share others' bot tokens, API keys, entity configurations, or personal information.

## Scope

This applies to all spaces associated with this project: issues, discussions, and any community channels.

## Enforcement

Unacceptable behavior can be reported to the maintainers. We'll address it as we see fit.
